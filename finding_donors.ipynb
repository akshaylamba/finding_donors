    "Welcome to the second project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer:In my opinion, the most appropriate solution to this problem would be achieved using the Adaboost ensemble model. As it can be observed from the plots, in comparison to SVC, both the Adaboost and the Random Forest algorithms are capable of both training on the entire data set and quickly performing predictions. However, at all training set sizes, the training and testing accuracies achieved with Adaboost are significantly higher than those obtained when using the simpler Random Forest algorithm and as high as those ahieved by the more complex SVC & random Forest model. Also, In terms of the Fbeta score, Adaboost slightly outperforms SVC & Random Forest at all training set sizes.\n",
    "When weighing all of these attributes, we can conclude that Adaboost is best suited for this problem. We will be able to fully utilize the entire dataset to maximize the performance in the unseen data without compromising on training and testing the speeds. Also, since we are more interested in maximizing the number of accurately classified people that make more than 50K, this model, which has the highest accuracy, seems to be the most appropriate. **"

    "**Answer:  Adaboost is a boosting type ensemble learner. This method works by combining multiple individual \"weak\" learning hypotheses to create one strong model....(BASIC IS SEVERAL WEAK LEARNER WHEN COMBINED BECOME STRONG). Each weak hypothesis used is better at classifying the data than random chance. However, it's the combination of all of these independent weak learning hypotheses what makes the model more capable of predicting accurately on unseen data than each of the individual hypothesis would.\n",
    "This algorithm is trained iteratively. During each training iteration, the model attempts to correctly classify the training data. Based on how well it performed during the iteration, the algorithm assigns higher weights to the observations that it was unable to classify correctly. On the next training iteration, the algorithm focuses on those more complex, initially missclassified observations, and tries to classify them correctly. Again based on the results of this training iteration Adaboost assigns higher weights to those observations that were missclassified. This process is repeated for a number of iterations defined by the user in an attempt to find the set of weighted hypotheses that combined will perform best on unseen data.\n",
    "Finally, to make predictions, Adaboost uses the weak independent hypotheses on which it was trained during each iteration and develops individual predictions that are then weighted accordingly to come up with the most probable single strong prediction. ** "

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Reducing the data to only five features also reduces the F-score and accuracy of the predictions. I believe this is due to the classifier not being able to accurately capture the complexity of the data and therefore not being able to properly generalize. However, if the training time was an important factor, reducing the number of features should reduce training time. Furthermore, since the impact on the accuracy and/or the F-scores is not too large, the small increase in classification error could be an appropriate tradeoff in that scenario.**"
